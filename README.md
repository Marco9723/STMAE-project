#LSTM GEAR
The goal of this project is to create a working plugin that emulates electric guitar effects using neural models in C++ through blackbox modelling of analog pedals. At the same time this plugin is intended to implement a chain of the above mentioned effects.

#SETUP
The project was done on Windows OS and is built using the CMake framework. 
It is necessary to create a folder for the project that contains another folder with the source code, a CMakeLists.txt and a README.md file.
It is necessary to include in the CMakeLists.txt the RTNeural library and save it locally on the PC. 
Be sure to change the path before running the build, as well for the JUCE path. 
The src folder contains the PluginProcessor.cpp and PluginProcessor.h files. In addition there are also the PluginEditor.h and PluginEditor.cpp files to make it possible to develop a GUI for our plugin. Add only .cpp files to the target sources.
It was also necessary to add in the private part of the target link libraries JUCE'S DSP module. It allows to define and use DSP processes quickly.
An external sound card to connect the guitar is also required with a low buffer size setup for latency issues (160 samples, low latency) and a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.
Once all this is done it will be possible to build the project using the command cmake -B build via terminal, after being positioned in the project folder.
Also remember to change the paths of the models in .json format in PluginProcessor.cpp and of the .png files loaded by the PluginEditor.cpp.
